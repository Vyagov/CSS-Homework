						<p>As in the 2 column exercise, the color change is detectible where the div meets the .jpg 
						background. I used the same hexidecimal number in the PS doc as was used in the HTML?</p>
						<p>This exercise uses a main wrapper background image as one fixed strip. I get serious Float
						Drop when I resize (reduce) the browser window. I think that is what "display:inline;/* stops
						IE doubling margin on float" is for, but would like further explaination to understand this
						comment.</p>
						<p>Is keeping the #wrapper div necessary in a stylesheet if there is also going to be seperate
						version wrappers as we have here to contain the different background images? Or perhaps this is
						an example of an inner div as the book suggests? I am still congused on that detail.</p>
						<p>Even though I have auto margin sets on the wrapper div, the page still huggs the left side?
						I've tried it in all of them, but it won't budge?</p>
						<p>Obviously, this footer has a mind of it's own...it's in the wrapper, but the "clear" seems
						to be allowing it outside. However, when I remove the clear, it hugs the bottom of the header?</p>
